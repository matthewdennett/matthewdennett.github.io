## About

I am a Network Engineer, working as an Automation and Security Engineer, living in Brisbane, Australia. 
I have a strong background in Cisco networking but have a broad range of interests in application delivery, security, automation and much more. 

## Work

I started as a Network Engineer in 2012 and worked directly in the Government sector where I was responsible for planning, deploying and maintaining highly available, secure networks across Australia and overseas. Since 2017 I have been working for a service integrator where I have delivered a vast range of network and security solutions for small and large enterprises. Over the past couple of years, I've had a much larger focus on delivering security and automatied solutions.
