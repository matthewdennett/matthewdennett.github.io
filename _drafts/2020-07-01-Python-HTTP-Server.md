I have been using the http.server python module for some time but recently, it's been more handy than ever. Wether it's testing network controls, Load Balancer configurations or simply copying a file from one location to another, the Python http.server module is going to be handy. Whichever the reason, the Python http.server module is so simple to use you can't afford not to know.
