Unfortunately, my {% include chip.html name="F5-201" %}certification has expired. So, I'm now on the path to resit my {% include chip.html name="F5-101" %}certification as the prerequisite for the {% include chip.html name="F5-201" %} certification. Here is a quick dump of my study notes that might be helpful if you're heading down the{% include chip.html name="F5" %}<a href="https://www.f5.com/learn/certification">certification path</a>.

<p>
With a few years of networking experience under my belt, I didn't need to rehash many of the fundamentals concepts, but I have still included them to help create a complete manifest of the knowledge needed. My goal here is to recap what I know, what I have brushed up on and what I expect to see on the{% include chip.html name="F5-101" %}exam. If you don't have a background in networking my study notes may still fall far short of everything you need to know for the{% include chip.html name="F5-101" %}exam. Either way, I would highly recommend you review the <a href="https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K29900360">exam blueprints</a> early in your study and again in the lead up to sitting the exam to ensure you haven't missed any topics.

#### IP Addressing
An IPv4 address has a size of 32 bits
An IPv6 address has a size of 128 bits


##### First Octet Rule
The class of address can be easily determined by examining the first octet of the address, and mapping that value to a class range below.

| Class      | First Octet |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| A          |     1 - 127 |
| B          |   128 - 191 |
| C          |   192 - 224 |

##### Private Addressing
There are three non-overlapping ranges of IPv4 addresses, reserved for private networks. These addresses are not routed on the Internet and their use does not be coordinated with an IP address registry. Any user may use any of the reserved blocks.

| CIDR Block     | Address Range                 | # Addresses |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| 10.0.0.0/24    | 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255     |    16777216 |
| 172.16.0.0/12  | 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255   |     1048576 |
| 192.168.0.0/16 | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 |       65536 |

##### IPv6 and Shortening
Addresses consist of 8 segments of 16 bits, 16 bytes or 128 bits long

- Zero Suppression: Because is it known that all 8 segments consist of 16 bits it is possible to remove any leading zeros from each section without making the address ambiguous.
- Zero Compression: Because it is known that each address must be made up of 8 segments it is possible to compress the first instance of multiple contiguous segments of all zeros without confusing the address. This is only allowed once within a single address.

#### Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model

In the OSI reference model, the communications between systems are split into seven different abstraction layers:

7.  Application layer
6.  Presentation layer
5.  Session layer
4.  Transport layer
3.  Network layer
2.  Data link layer
1.  Physical layer

##### 1.  Physical layer
The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device, such as a network interface controller, Ethernet hub, or network switch, and a physical transmission medium. It converts the digital bits into electrical, radio, or optical signals. **Bits** are used on the Physical layer.

##### 2.  Data link layer
The data link layer provides node-to-node data transfer, a link between two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. **Frames** and **MAC** addresses are used on the Data link layer.

##### 3.  Network layer
The network layer transfers **packets** from one node to another. Node can be on different networks where the **packet** may need to be routed intermediate nodes. If the message is too large to be transmitted from one node to another on the data link layer between those nodes, the network may split the message into several fragments at one node, sending the fragments independently, and reassembling the fragments at another node. Packets and IP address' are used on the Network layer.

##### 4.  Transport layer
The transport layer is responsible for delivering, error checking, flow control, and sequencing data packets. It regulates the sequencing, size, and transfer of data between the 2 endpoints. It is the fist layer in the OSI model that is end to end. All lower layers are point to point. It gets the data from the session layer and breaks it into transportable segments. Two examples of the Transport Layer are the **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) and **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol). SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK

##### 5.  Session layer
The session layer will create communication channels, called sessions, between different devices. This layer is responsible for opening those sessions and ensuring that they’re functional during data transfer.It is also responsible for authentication and reconnections, and it can set checkpoints during a data transfer.

##### 6.  Presentation layer
The presentation layer is responsible for ensuring that the data is understandable for the end system or useful for later stages. It translates or formats data based on the application’s syntax or semantics. It also manages any encryption or decryption required by the application layer.

##### 6.  Application layer
The application layer is the layer of the OSI model that is closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with a software application that implements a component of communication between the client and server. Application-layer functions typically include file sharing, message handling, and database access, through the most common protocols at the application layer, known as HTTP, FTP, SMB/CIFS, TFTP, and SMTP.

#### SSL/Certificates
##### SSL Configurations
An F5 may be configured in several different ways to handel SSL connections:
- **Full SSL Proxy / SSL Re-Encryption / SSL Bridging / SSL Terminations** - In this method the BIG-IP will re-encrypt the traffic before sending it to the servers. Client sends encrypted traffic to BIG-IP, the BIG-IP then decrypts it and before sending it to the pool members re-encrypts it again. This method is generally used to satisfy the requirement of traffic to be encrypted between the LTM and Servers as well. When this method is used the servers will also have to decrypt and encrypt the traffic.
- **SSL Offloading** - In this method the client traffic is sent encrypted to BIG-IP. The BIG-IP is decrypts the traffic and sends the decrypted traffic to the server. Instead of the server decrypting and re-encrypting the traffic BIG-IP handles that removing the crypto overhead from the server.
- **SSL Passthrough** - As the name suggests the BIG-IP will just pass the traffic from client to servers absolving itself from any SSL related workload. Usually this setup is used if the applications do not support SSL proxy or cannot consume decrypted traffic. Since it’s just pass through LTM cannot read the headers which introduces limitations on persistence. Only non SSL information in the packet can be used to maintain persistence like source ip address, destination ip address.

#### ARP
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, MAC address, associated with a given IP address, typically an IPv4 address.

##### ARP Process Example
Two computers (Computer 1 and Computer 2) are connected to each other on a LAN by Ethernet cables and a switch, with no gateways or routers. Computer 1 has a packet to send to Computer 2. Through DNS, it determines that Computer 2 has the IP address 192.168.0.55.
- To send the message, it also requires Computer 2's MAC address.
- First, Computer 1 uses a cached ARP table to look up 192.168.0.55 for any existing records of Computer 2's MAC address (00:EB:24:B2:05:AC).
- If the MAC address is found, it sends an Ethernet frame containing the IP packet onto the link with the destination address 00:EB:24:B2:05:AC.
- If the cache did not produce a result for 192.168.0.55, Computer 1 has to send a broadcast ARP request message (destination FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF MAC address), which is accepted by all computers on the local network, requesting an answer for 192.168.0.55. ```Who has 192.168.0.55? Tell 192.168.0.22.```
- Computer 2 responds with an ARP response message containing its MAC and IP addresses. As part of fielding the request, Computer 2 may insert an entry for Computer 1 into its ARP table for future use.
- Computer 1 receives and caches the response information in its ARP table and can now send the packet.

###### BIG-IP

#### HA
 TBD


#### MAC Masquerading
You should consider using MAC masquerading under the following conditions:
- To minimize Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) communication or dropped packets during traffic group failover events.
- To improve reliability and failover speed in lossy networks.
- To improve interoperability with switches that are slow to respond to gratuitous ARP requests.

To optimize the flow of traffic during failover events, you can configure MAC masquerade addresses for any defined traffic groups on the BIG-IP. A MAC masquerade address is a unique, floating MAC address that you create. You can assign one MAC masquerade address to each traffic group on a BIG-IP. By assigning a MAC masquerade address to a traffic group, you associate that address with any floating IP addresses associated with the traffic group. By configuring a MAC masquerade address for each traffic group, a single VLAN can potentially carry traffic and services for multiple traffic groups, with each service having its own MAC masquerade address.

To configure
- ```tmsh```
- ```modify /cm traffic-group <traffic_group> mac <mac_address>```
- ```save /sys config```


#### Route Selection
Routes to a destination network prefix will be selected based on the following order
- Route Specificity - Longest prefix match
- Administrative Distance
- Metric - The calculated weight/cost of the route generated by the routing protocol with that route

| Route Source   | AD Value |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Connected      |        0 |
| Static route   |        1 |
| EIGRP summary  |        5 |
| External BGP   |       20 |
| EIGRP	         |       90 |
| OSPF	         |      110 |
| IS-IS          |      115 |
| RIP            |      120 |
| External EIGRP |      170 |
| Internal BGP   |      200 |


#### HTTP

##### Error Codes

| Code | Type          | Description
| ---- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1xx  | Informational | The request was received, continuing process |
| 2xx  | successful    | The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted |
| 3xx  | redirection   | Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request |
| 4xx  | client error  | The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled |
| 5xx  | server error  | The server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request |

##### Common Codes
- 200 OK = Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
- 201 Created = The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource
- 301 Moved Permanently = This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.
- 302 Found (Previously "Moved temporarily") + Tells the client to look at (browse to) another URL.
- 400 Bad Request = The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message).
- 401 Unauthorized = Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
- 403 Forbidden = The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action.
- 404 Not Found = The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future
- 500 Internal Server Error = A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.
- 502 Bad Gateway = The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- 503 Service Unavailable = The server cannot handle the request (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance).
