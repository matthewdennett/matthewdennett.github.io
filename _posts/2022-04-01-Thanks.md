This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and customised from the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme) theme. Without each of these, this site would not be here.

### GitHub Pages
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub directly from your repository. You can use GitHub Pages to host a page for your open source projects, host a blog, or even share your resume.


### Jekyll
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > "Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub."

Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).


### Lanyon
Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
